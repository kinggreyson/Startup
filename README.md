## Startup Application Deliverable

### Brief Description

The title of my startup project is Ranking with Friends. As expressed in the title this project will allow friends to collaborate together to rank their favorite self-created subjects. As shown in rough sketches down below this uses the tier list system (S, A, B, C, D) with an unranked category beneath them all. The collaboration comes in the form of creator and participant. The creator goes to a page to create a category and a dynamic list of items to rank within that category. After creation a server generated join code is made that the creator can tell other participants authenticating that the right people are in the group.

### Elevator Pitch

Have you ever wondered how your opinions compare to your friends? Welcome to "Ranking with Friends" a new ranking system that allows friends to get together and rank anything from movies to basketball players. Using the template of tier lists allows for interesting rankings that can always be different through the voting system.

### Design

### Key Features

- Secure lobbies with server generated join codes
- Custom Tier lists with different topics and items
- Voting System for each item and the given tiers
- Tier List results are stored
- Ability to create individual username

### Technologies
#### I am going to use the required techologies in these ways:

- **HTML** - HTML is the framework for the application. Multiple HTML pages: Main menu, tier list creation, join page, tier list, and voting.
- **CSS** - CSS is the styling of the application. Used for different colors and font sizes depending on what is needed as seen in the design sketch.
- **React** - React will be used in the join code process/login. It will also be used in the voting system
- **Service** - Endpoints:
    1. Submitting votes
    2. Allocating correct items to correct tiers based on the tally
    3. Showing results
- **DB** 
    1. Storing custom topics/ideas for tier list
    2. Storing saved completed tier lists
    3. Remembering Votes and tier placement
- **Websocket** 
    1. Showing user votes to everyone
    2. Live chat sidebar
    3. Display the number of users voting on the list
